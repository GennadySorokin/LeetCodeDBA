175. Combine Two Tables
SQL Schema

Create table If Not Exists Person (personId int, firstName varchar(255), lastName varchar(255))
Create table If Not Exists Address (addressId int, personId int, city varchar(255), state varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (personId, lastName, firstName) values ('1', 'Wang', 'Allen')
insert into Person (personId, lastName, firstName) values ('2', 'Alice', 'Bob')
Truncate table Address
insert into Address (addressId, personId, city, state) values ('1', '2', 'New York City', 'New York')
insert into Address (addressId, personId, city, state) values ('2', '3', 'Leetcode', 'California')

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

Answer:
To report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table along with their corresponding address information (if available). 
we can use a LEFT JOIN between the Person and Address tables. This will include all rows from the left table (Person) and the matching rows from the right table (Address).
If there is no match in the Address table, the result will contain NULL values for city and state.

SQL query (MySQL, MS SQL):
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;

Explanation:
We select the first name (firstName) and last name (lastName) columns from the Person table.
We perform a LEFT JOIN between the Person table (p) and the Address table (a) on the personId column. 
This will join the rows from both tables where the personId matches, and if there is no matching address for a person, it will still include that person's information in the result with NULL values for city and state.
The result will contain the first name, last name, city, and state for each person, and NULL for city and state if there is no address available for that person in the Address table.
